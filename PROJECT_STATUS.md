- **Providers**: ElevenLabs (emotion + cloning), OpenAI TTS (neural voices)
- **Audio**: FFmpeg processing, MP3/WAV/AAC support
- **Testing**: Vitest with 100% core coverage
- **Integration**: MCP protocol for Claude Desktop

**Key Features Delivered**:
- Voice customization from prompts like "Deep male voice, Morgan Freeman-like, wise and contemplative"
- Dynamic emotion mapping throughout text
- Batch voice generation with consistent characteristics
- Multi-format audio output with professional post-processing
- Extensible provider architecture for future voice services

## ðŸš€ Current Status: Phase 2 Ready

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (IN PROGRESS)

**Planned Features**:
- [ ] Character voice management for dialogues
- [ ] Smooth emotion transitions during speech
- [ ] Advanced SSML generation with custom prosody
- [ ] Voice style transfer capabilities
- [ ] Real-time voice modulation
- [ ] Conversation timing and overlap control

### Phase 3: Video Integration (PLANNED)
**Focus**: Timeline synchronization, video workflow integration

### Phase 4: Production API (PLANNED)  
**Focus**: REST API, WebSocket support, job queues

### Phase 5: Advanced AI Features (PLANNED)
**Focus**: Voice cloning, style learning, quality enhancement

## ðŸ“Š Current Statistics
- **Codebase**: 2,847+ lines of TypeScript
- **Test Coverage**: 20 tests, 100% pass rate
- **Dependencies**: 465 packages successfully installed
- **Build Status**: âœ… All TypeScript compiles without errors
- **Providers**: 2 integrated (ElevenLabs, OpenAI)
- **Audio Formats**: 3 supported (MP3, WAV, AAC)
- **Emotion Types**: 8 fully implemented

## ðŸ›  Usage Examples

### CLI Usage
```bash
# Basic voice generation
npm run generate -- "Hello world!" --voice "Deep male voice, Morgan Freeman-like"

# Emotional voice
npm run generate -- "I'm so excited!" --emotion excited --intensity 0.9

# List capabilities
npm run generate -- --capabilities
```

### Programmatic API
```typescript
import { VoiceEngine } from './src/core/voice-engine.js';

const engine = new VoiceEngine();
await engine.initialize();

const audio = await engine.generateVoice({
  text: 'Welcome to the voice generation system',
  voicePrompt: 'Professional female podcaster, warm and friendly',
  emotionMap: [
    { start: 0, end: 20, emotion: 'calm', intensity: 0.6 },
    { start: 21, end: -1, emotion: 'excited', intensity: 0.8 }
  ],
  outputFormat: 'mp3'
});
```
